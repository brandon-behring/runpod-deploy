# Changelog

This project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `--verbose` / `--quiet` flags on every CLI subcommand. `--verbose` raises
  the log level to `DEBUG` and surfaces a handful of new debug records
  (rsync source/dest, ssh return codes, JSON payload types). `--quiet`
  lowers it to `WARNING` so info chatter is suppressed.
- `runpod-deploy logs --config <path>` — live-tail the current pod's run
  log over SSH. Discovers the pod's host/port from `runpodctl pod get`
  using the pod id persisted in the config's state file. Supports
  `--lines N` (default 200) and `--no-follow` (print and exit instead of
  `tail -f`).
- `transport.RemoteRunner.ssh_stream(command)` — runs a remote command
  with stdout/stderr inherited from the parent process. Used by the new
  `logs` subcommand to stream `tail -f` output in real time.

### Changed

- `print()` calls in `cli.py`, `orchestrator.py`, `provider.py`, and
  `transport.py` migrated to the stdlib `logging` module. CLI output is
  byte-for-byte equivalent under default configuration; library consumers
  can now filter via the `runpod_deploy` logger.
- `transport.print_cmd` renamed to `transport.log_cmd(logger, label, argv)`;
  signature now takes the caller's logger explicitly.
- `run.script_path` and `run.log_path` now accept template variables (e.g.
  `{volume_mount}/script.sh`), matching `artifacts.remote_path` and
  `staging.destination`. Relative paths are still rejected.

### Fixed

- `provider.stop_pod` warning ("failed to stop pod") now routes to stderr
  via `logger.warning`. Previously emitted on stdout, which polluted
  captured CLI output (`runpod-deploy ... | tee log`).
