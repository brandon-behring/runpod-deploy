# Changelog

This project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `print()` calls in `cli.py`, `orchestrator.py`, `provider.py`, and
  `transport.py` migrated to the stdlib `logging` module. CLI output is
  byte-for-byte equivalent under default configuration; library consumers
  can now filter via the `runpod_deploy` logger.
- `transport.print_cmd` renamed to `transport.log_cmd(logger, label, argv)`;
  signature now takes the caller's logger explicitly.

### Fixed

- `provider.stop_pod` warning ("failed to stop pod") now routes to stderr
  via `logger.warning`. Previously emitted on stdout, which polluted
  captured CLI output (`runpod-deploy ... | tee log`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Initial config-driven RunPod orchestration package.
- Single-job v1 schema.
- CLI for validation, dry-runs, execution, and state-file stop.
- Examples for prompt-injection-v3, prompt-injection-sdd, post_transformers,
  and research-kb.
